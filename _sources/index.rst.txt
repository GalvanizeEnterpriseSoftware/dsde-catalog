.. important:: At Galvanize we hold a core belief that anyone with enough dedicated time and motivation can become a
               data professional. We use skills assessments and fundamentals courses to ensure career paths are open to
               everyone.


For all of our products that we offer through Galvanize Enterprise there are two important distinctions:
**accountability** and **product alignment** through offering flexibility.  At the core of each of our products is a
desire to deliver the best possible experience for students and importantly that experience is optimized for outcomes.
Creating individual learning paths is also part of our product delivery strategy because a rigid *one-size fits all*
approach to content delivery does not align well with the myriad of skills that are being used today by data
professionals.

Becoming a data professional is a long road and one that can be far less bumpy when instructors are actively guiding
the student experience.  Whether an instructor is part of the journey full-time, part-time or only occasionally it is
important that students are held accountable for the work they set out to do.
