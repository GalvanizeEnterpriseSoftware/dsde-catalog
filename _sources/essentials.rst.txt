Essentials
*************************************

The essentials courses provide the foundational skills needed for all data professionals. There are two components to
this training: *Programming* and *Mathematics*. Python is the most commonly used tool for Data Science used in industry today.
We will teach R/Python programming and the associated ecosystem of tools that are common to working with data---**that is the
essentials for a programming language are taught through the lens of working with data**.

With a solid footing in R/Python it is easier to teach the math and stats fundamentals, because the concepts come to
life through code and examples.  The mathematics training could be considered a refresher-level training on
undergraduate level concepts in linear algebra, probability, and statistics.

We start students who are making a career pivot or who are otherwise new to the field with programming, because utilities
that are available in the language itself open up a plethora of learning options.  It is important to keep in
mind that with the essentials all of our content is vocational and every topic has been hand selected for a specific
reason related to data analytics.

    Linear algebra and statistics drive the modern landscape of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  A
    fundamental understanding of the essentials is a requirement to effectively use sophisticated modeling techniques,
    but it is also an important and often overlooked component of day-to-day work in data analytics.
