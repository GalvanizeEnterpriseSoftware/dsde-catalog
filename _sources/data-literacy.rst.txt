Data Literacy
*************************************

Ensuring basic data literacy across a company is a critical step towards becoming a data-driven organization.  The data
culture of a company is the degree to which the organization as a whole embraces data products and data-driven
decision making.  In modern organizations data professionals, like data scientists and machine learning engineers, are
tasked with crafting data products in the form of dashboards, reports, web-applications and more.  To ensure these
products contribute to increased profitability they must inform decision making horizontally across business units and
vertically within.  Becoming data-driven is an organization-wide effort and ensuring everyone can speak the language
of data will result in better data products and increased adoption of those products.

Programming is no longer reserved for computer scientists.  Modern programming languages, like Python, are easier to use
than ever before and the ceiling on how useful they are is higher than ever before. Anyone with basics computer skills,
in just a few weeks of effort can learn programming skills that would increase productivity in their day-to-day tasks.
In the context of data literacy Python is a tool to augment and automate tasks.  It also decreases reliance on
spreadsheet tools.  There are two data literacy tracks: one that exposes students to the elements of data literacy
including databases and another that covers the same topics through the lens of simplified programming.
