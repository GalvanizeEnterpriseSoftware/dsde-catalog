Data Science
*************************************

This course will enable technical teams by providing a comprehensive training that produces an efficient junior data
scientist. Employees will build from the programming and mathematical fundamentals into the state-of-the-art.  Students
will journey through the landscape of machine learning spending time on supervised, unsupervised and deep-learning
families of algorithms.  High-performance computing and model deployment using containerization help ensure that the
model-building is rooted in practical application.
